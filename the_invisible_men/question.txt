The zip file will contain multiple files, but your target is '{file_name}'.
The contents of this file are hidden in plain sight, yet disguised. Unveil its true form first, and only then will its secrets become clear.

Once you’ve deciphered it, count every character in its revealed state—this will be your COUNT.
Look closely; somewhere within lies a hidden identifier in the format ENIGMA{{RandomValue}}.

Piece it all together to form the flag as ENIGMA{{RandomValue_COUNT}}.
The answer lies beneath the surface—are you keen-eyed enough to unlock it?
